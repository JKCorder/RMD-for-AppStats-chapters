# RMD-for-AppStats-chapters

Individual RMD files for each chapter in Applied Statistics - reflects the version published on github on 30 October 2021.

With one exception, this collection of RMD files plus the  data folder, image folder and bibligraphy permits anyone to edit and knit individual chapters from my Applied Statistics notes.

The exception:  You will need to download a copy of the 2020 ANES from ICPSR (electionstudies.org) and add that to the data folder.  Several chapter files call this file from the data folder (reading with the haven package):  anes_timeseries_2020_stata_20210719.dta - so if you download a lter version, be sure to update the filename in the RMD files.
